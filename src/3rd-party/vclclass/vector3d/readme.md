# 3-dimensional vectors

# Add-on package for Vector Class Library

3-dimensional vectors are useful in geometry and physics.
The file vector3d.h provides vector classes, operators, and functions for 
calculations with 3-D vectors

## File list:
* vector3d.h: C++ header file, defining 3-D classes, operators, and functions
* vector3d_manual.pdf: Instruction manual
* testbench_vector3d.cpp: Test program for testing vector3d.h during development. Not required for applications
* test_vector3d.lst: Test cases for testbench_vector3d.cpp
* vector3d_manual.tex: Source for building vector3d_manual.pdf
* freesoftwarelogo.jpg: Used by vector3d_manual.tex
